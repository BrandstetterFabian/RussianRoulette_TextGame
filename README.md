# RUSSIAN ROULETTE
This is an easy text-based game in which you play russian roulette.
There are 4 different game modes from which you can choose (Classic Mode, Extended Classic Mode, DeadEye Mode and Hybrid Mode) that are explained in the README.
The game is pretty self-explanatory, so I will just describe the different game modes.

## Classic Mode
In Classic Mode there is a total of 1 round in which each participant has to shoot himself with the gun. If the gun was empty you were lucky. There are 
6 participants (including you) and a gun with a magazine of 6 rounds which contains only 1 bullet. This means that after the round 5 participants survive and 1 dies.
Make sure that you are part of the survivors!
